# Bitvavo C++ HMAC Signature Test

This project demonstrates a **C++ HMAC SHA256 signature mismatch** when calling the Bitvavo API, despite identical signing logic working flawlessly in Python and on other exchanges like Kraken.

## Issue Summary

- C++ HMAC logic works perfectly on **Kraken**
- Python HMAC logic works perfectly on **Bitvavo**
- C++ HMAC logic **fails on Bitvavo**, despite generating the same base64 HMAC signature

We strongly suspect Bitvavo's backend rejects the request based on subtle implementation or formatting differences ‚Äî possibly involving newline characters, timestamps, or headers.

## üß™ Kraken Comparison

To rule out general implementation bugs, we ran the same C++ signing logic on Kraken's API.

- HMAC signatures **were accepted** by Kraken's backend using the same `crypto++` library
- Bitvavo rejects these exact signatures, even when the `pre_sign` input is byte-for-byte identical

---

## Why This Matters

Bitvavo has **no official C++ SDK**, and current C++ integrations are blocked due to this signature mismatch. This repo may help others debug or reverse-engineer what Bitvavo expects.

- Signature verification bugs
- API header formatting issues
- Known Bitvavo HMAC edge cases
